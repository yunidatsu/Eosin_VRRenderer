# Eosin_VRRenderer

## Overview

This is a GitHub version of [Eosin's VRRenderer Plugin](https://hub.virtamate.com/resources/video-renderer-for-3d-vr180-vr360-and-flat-2d-audio-bvh-animation-recorder.11994/) for Virt-A-Mate. See that link for further information.

This **isn't an official repository for the plugin**, but my (yunidatsu) private one for releasing some changes I'm doing to it.
